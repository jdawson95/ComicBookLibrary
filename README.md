# Comic Book Library Manager

This project was built using a 173 minute course on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a>. In this course I used ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework to allow users to create, update, and delete comic books from their digital library. In this project I used EF related code in its own class library project, and make it retrive and persist data from within the web app.
